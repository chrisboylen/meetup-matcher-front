# Meetup Matcher

This project is working off [The Meetup API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/)  
The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and enter a city and state location.  Then recieve a list of meetups for that location based on user preferences.

Using Firebase realtime database as a backend, I set up a separate client-side application using create-react-app.
